**Main Priorities**
- update food-features.xlsx if new dataset is added.
- change yolo and xgboost model if new dataset is trained.
- update food_mapper.py if new food is added.

**Not So Important Priorities**
- update requirements.txt for new libraries installed
- update features.py if change from xgboost to another model as food_type requires different processing techniques
